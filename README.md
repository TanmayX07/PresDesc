# PresDesc
This is for my final year Minor Project work. The major goal of this MERN project is to improve prescription data entry within Electronic Medical Record (EMR) software, to increase speed and efficiency over old handwritten approaches considerably. Our project aims to provide a streamlined, user-friendly solution that optimizes the prescription entry process, ultimately improving healthcare workflow, patient care, and the overall efficiency of the healthcare ecosystem by addressing the complexities and challenges of healthcare data, data security, and user adaptation.
